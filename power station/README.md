# Power station

Ablution block needs a power solution to be able to power all systems that need electrycity (brains, sensors, heating, water pump, light etc.)
A small power station can exist as a module on it's own and be included in Ablution Block where there is no connection to the grid. 
Power station should be designed in the way that can be scaled up in terms of power production. 

Primery solutio for this will include: 
* solar panels
* charge controller
* batteries

Potentiall combine Solar energy with wind tubine or hydro where possible, for example in windy areas and near water streams.
