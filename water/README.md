# Water Solutions

## Drinking water 
In some locations where there is unverified water source or no water source, it would be great if Ablution block could have some kind of water collection and filtration system. 
Water filtration system can make sure that there is a source of drinking / technical water that is safe to use.


## Waste Water
There is a lof of water used by human life actyvities (washing, cooking) that needs to be reused, preserved or safely disposed. 
We want to experiment with grey and black water filtration systems. 
Filtering water to the level that it can be used again as technical water could reduce total water consumption. 

### Grey water
Seperating grey water can make it much easier to clean and reuse water. Using available filters in conjunction with biological ways to clean water (ponds, plant etc.)



### Black water
We would like to work on low cost and effcicient alternative to septic tanks for black water. One of the alternatives available on the market is Bio-Septics of different types. 
Our aim is to test existing systems in order to developing an open source set of instructions for producing bio-septic.
