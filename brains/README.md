# A section dedicated to the brains of Ablution block

In order to keep track of the efficiency of the Ablution block and being able to fine tune systems and programs them we would like to use some kind of IoT system. 

Smart system to control ablution block should include but not limited to:  

* water usage meter 
* heating smart contloller
* Multiple sensors data logging
* Seasonal optimal settings for systems
* Lighting smart controller
* general use logging

Ideas how to make it: 

Cobmine Arduino with multiple sesnors and relays with Raspberry pi for main control and OpenHub https://www.openhab.org/ as a software to link it all.
