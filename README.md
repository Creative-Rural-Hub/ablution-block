# Open Source off grid ablution block

## Definition
Ablution block is a simple structure with toilets, showers, and wash basins, for communal use, as at a camping ground, caravan park , etc. It can also include facilities for cooking food, washing cloth and common sitting area. 

## Background 
We have been experimenting with various systems for sustainable  lifestyle, including composting, grey water management, solar power, sustainable water management and food growing because there is real need in our space (Creative Rural Hub) for that, since there is no central water or canalisation and electric capacity are limited to old village line capacity. A lot of these experiements created background for development of the off grid movable ablution block, that could provide large number of people with access to basic facilities (washing, cooking, wc). All these activities has became super relevant and urgent due to ongoin war in Ukraine, in order to cope with large number of people moved to safer territories, and to help rebuild destroyed cities and villiges.
